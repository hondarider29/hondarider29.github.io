## A Twitter Ads Heuristic Evaluation

**Overview**

Twitter as a social media platform launched in July 2006. And in April of 2013 Twitter announced its Twitter Ads self-service platform, this advertisement system consists of promoted tweets, and promoted accounts. These ads are now commonplace, and I was interested in how well they meshed with the rest of Twitter, which I will analyze with a heuristic evaluation.

**Simple and Natural Dialogue:**

Twitter Ads encompasses the less is more ideal very well, by integrating the ads into the home feed, and search screens. They do not add anything that was not already there and only use features that were already on those screens.
